# Triturus_RADseq_Y

This repository hosts scripts used in the study: "Identification of Y-chromosome Turnover in Newts Fails to Support a Sex Chromosome Origin for the Triturus Balanced Lethal System" by France et al. (2024).

Bioinformatic analysis data consisted of three main arms:

1) Identification of candidate Y-linked markers from RADseq data from adult Triturus ivanbureschi samples of known sex
2) Creation of a RADseq based linkage map for Triturus ivanbureschi, and incorperation of Y-linked markers
3) Incorperation of Y-linked markers into previously constructed target capture based linkage maps for both Triturus and Lissotriton

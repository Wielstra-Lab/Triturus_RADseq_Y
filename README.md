# Triturus_RADseq_Y #

This repository hosts scripts used in the study: "Identification of Y-chromosome Turnover in Newts Fails to Support a Sex Chromosome Origin for the Triturus Balanced Lethal System" by France et al. (2024).

Bioinformatic analysis data consisted of three main arms:

1) Identification of candidate Y-linked markers from RADseq data from adult Triturus ivanbureschi samples of known sex
2) Creation of a RADseq based linkage map for Triturus ivanbureschi, and incorporation of Y-linked markers
3) Comparative genomics with the linkage map Triturus compared to the genome of Pluerodeles Waltl (which allows further comparison with the previously published linkage maps constructed for Lissotriton vulgaris)
